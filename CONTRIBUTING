I'm very happy to receive contributions, don't be afraid to send in patches.

For coding style, follow the Linux kernel coding style available at

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle

All code you contribute must be licensed according to the LICENSE file. You
may of course only contribute code that you have written yourself or
otherwise have rights to pass on as an open source patch as per the terms in
the LICENSE file.

Your commits must be done using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or
anonymous contributions).

To actually get your code in, either send me a mail at andreas@gazonk.org with
your patch or create a pull request in github. Either works fine. If you're
unsure on something, just drop me a mail. Most of the times I'll be happy to
answer.

Happy hacking!

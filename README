devcharset is a CUSE (Character Device in UserSpace) implementation of a device
node similar to /dev/zero, but with a modifiable character set. It can output
any combination of characters and ranges.

WHERE TO GET IT

  The official repository is at github: https://github.com/andbof/devcharset

BASIC INSTALLATION

  Run "./configure" and correct any errors reported, such as installing
  missing packages. If "configure" doesn't exist, you've most likely cloned
  the git repository, and you need to run "./bootstrap" first (if bootstrap
  complains about missing files, you need to install autoconf and automake;
  see your distributions documentation on how to do that).

  Compile by running "make", followed by "sudo make install" to do a standard
  system-wide installation. If you want to install into another directory, such
  as into your home, run "./configure --prefix=/full/installation/path",
  followed by "make" and "make install".

CONFIGURING

  At runtime, devcharset can be configured to use for example a different
  character set, a different random device or use a different charset device
  node name.

  The character set is given as a list of characters or range of characters in
  normal, hexadecimal, decimal or octal form. The following examples are all
  equivalent and will use the US ASCII alphabet (i.e. lowercase 'a' to 'z'):

  devcharset -c a-z		(normal character range)
  devcharset -c abcd-uvw-z	(more advanced ranges)
  devcharset -c '\97-\122'	(decimal values are prefixed with '\')
  devcharset -c '\x61-\x7a'	(hexadecimal values are prefixed with '\x')
  devcharset -c '\0141-\0172'	(octal values are prefixed with '\0')
  devcharset -c '\0141 \98 c-z'	(space separated characters and ranges)

  Additional help is available by running "devcharset -h"

RUNNING

  Start the binary (devcharset). Assuming you have CUSE support compiled in and
  the currently logged in user has access to /dev/fuse, a device node will be
  created (the default name is /dev/charset).

  Reading from /dev/charset will output random characters in the character set
  specified by "-c", or the default set of "a-z" if nothing special has been
  specified.
